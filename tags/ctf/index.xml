As a part of the SecTalks May CTF I built a .Net reverse engineering challenge, Cracknet. I&amp;rsquo;ve since made this available on Github, here.
Although it&amp;rsquo;s possible to complete this challenge by bypassing a JMP instruction in assembly the intention of this challenge was to introduce participants to decompiling .Net applications by patching the application.
Exploring CrackNet functionality When you first open CrackNet you&amp;rsquo;re presented with the following:</description></item><item><title>Understanding Integer Overflows - CrikeyCon 2017, Impossible Math Writeup</title><link>https://codingo.com/posts/2017-03-08-ctf-writeup-crikeycon-2017-impossiblemath/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:10:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://codingo.com/posts/2017-03-08-ctf-writeup-crikeycon-2017-impossiblemath/</guid><description>Category: Coding Points: 400 Solves: 7 Description: ctf.crikeycon.com:43981 Enumeration Before doing anything else on the host since we were provided with an unual port and address I attempted to ncat to it, receiving the following:
Identifying the core problem Since the math is impossible there’s likely a trick here. With that in mind I figure we need to overload an operator (integer overflow) and try passing a large number as input:</description></item><item><title>CrikeyCon 2017 - Fast Math Writeup</title><link>https://codingo.com/posts/2017-03-08-crikeycon-2017-fastmath/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:01:58 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://codingo.com/posts/2017-03-08-crikeycon-2017-fastmath/</guid><description>Category: Coding Points: 300 Solves: 14 Description: crikeyconctf.dook.biz:23776 Enumeration Before doing anything else on this host I attempted to connect to it, receiving the following:
The time between being presented with the challenge and receiving a timeout was a mere two seconds. Although handy with a calculator this wouldn’t be possible without a script/bot. I also noted that the response and timing to answer didn’t change on a second connection, but the base operator did.</description></item></channel></rss>
