Put simply, arbitrage is buying something at a low price and selling more or less immediately at a higher price through a different market. There are many kinds of arbitrage, but all of them boil more or less to the same goal: Capitalizing on a price difference for economic gain.
Arbitrage is everywhere in our global economy and lots of commercial transactions depend upon it and utilize it.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://codingo.com/posts/2014-09-19-proof-of-stake-advantages/ class="link black dim">Proof of Stake – How does it work and what are the advantages?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Recently more and more alt coins have decided to integrate a proof of stake system over the traditional proof of work system used by Bitcoin and Litecoin. But why, one may ask? Frankly, the proof of work system is not perfect. A cryptocurrency without proof of stake doesn’t just lack an incentive for users to continue holding on to their coins, but is also susceptible to a 51 percent attack if one party controls a majority of the total mining output.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://codingo.com/posts/2013-01-02-bitcoin-wallet-differences/ class="link black dim">Bitcoin Wallets: What are the differences between them?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Satoshi Nakamoto first published their paper on Bitcoin back in 2009, but it didn’t reach real mainstream popularity until recently. Only the users who understand the highly technical mechanics of Bitcoin invested their time in the technology during 2009-13 intermission period. In February of 2013 Bitcoin, and soon cryptocurrencies in general, finally entered the public consciousness. Despite being a four year old technology, many of the core features of the Bitcoin protocol were not polished in any capacity, let alone ready for mass public consumption.</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/categories/ctf-writeup-programming-crikeycon class="link blue hover-black">Category: ctf-writeup-programming-crikeycon</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://codingo.com/posts/2017-03-08-crikeycon-2017-fastmath/ class="link black dim">CrikeyCon 2017 - Fast Math Writeup</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Category: Coding Points: 300 Solves: 14 Description: crikeyconctf.dook.biz:23776 Enumeration Before doing anything else on this host I attempted to connect to it, receiving the following:
The time between being presented with the challenge and receiving a timeout was a mere two seconds. Although handy with a calculator this wouldn’t be possible without a script/bot.

Identifying the core problem Since the math is impossible there’s likely a trick here. With that in mind I figure we need to overload an operator (integer overflow) and try passing a large number as input:</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/categories/reverse-engineering-ctf class="link blue hover-black">Category: reverse-engineering-ctf</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=https://codingo.com/posts/2017-07-25-decompiling-csharp-by-example-with-cracknet/ class="link black dim">Decompiling C# by Example with Cracknet</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">What is Cracknet? As a part of the SecTalks May CTF I built a .Net reverse engineering challenge, Cracknet. I&rsquo;ve since made this available on Github, here.
Although it&rsquo;s possible to complete this challenge by bypassing a JMP instruction in assembly the intention of this challenge was to introduce participants to decompiling .Net applications by patching the application.
